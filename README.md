# College Social Network

Web application intends to provide a well-established web-based Social
Network system between a professors and students. This project aims to
develop a website which provides a Communication among peoples on
network, which works quite similar to Social Media Site. This website also
provides the features of writing and posting a post or any event all at one
place. The main idea behind it is to share the updates posted via adding a 
post which can be read by all the student as well as faculty
using the website.

- Go to php.ini file (there could be two of them). Make these changes in configuration
- `post-max-size` (change 8M to 800M).
- `upload-max-filesize` (change 2M to 2000M).
